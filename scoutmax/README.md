# AI Agent System Configuration

This repository contains all the necessary configuration files and documentation to set up an AI agent similar to Scout. The system is designed to be modular, configurable, and extensible.

## Configuration Files

### Core System Files

- **system_prompt_template.md**: Template for creating a system prompt with placeholders for customization
- **example_system_prompt.md**: A concrete example of a fully implemented system prompt
- **function_definitions.json**: Definitions of all available functions/tools for the agent
- **environment_variables.json**: Environment variables and settings for the agent
- **tool_descriptions.md**: Detailed descriptions and usage guidelines for each tool
- **implementation_config.json**: Configuration for the agent's runtime behavior
- **task_planning_template.json**: Template for structured task planning
- **agent_initialization.js**: Example script for initializing the agent

### Analysis Documents

- **system_prompt_analysis.md**: Analysis of key components in an effective system prompt
- **system_prompt_structure.md**: Analysis of the optimal structure for a system prompt

## Getting Started

1. **Create System Prompt**: Use the `system_prompt_template.md` as a starting point. Replace placeholders with your specific values.

2. **Configure Environment**: Modify `environment_variables.json` with your specific environment details.

3. **Customize Functions**: Adjust `function_definitions.json` to include only the tools your agent should have access to.

4. **Initialize Agent**: Use the `agent_initialization.js` script as a reference for initializing your agent with the properly configured system prompt and function definitions.

## System Prompt Structure

The system prompt is structured into several key sections:

1. **Identity and Role**: Defines who the agent is and its purpose
2. **Core Capabilities**: Lists what the agent can do
3. **Personality and Communication Style**: Sets the tone and style of interaction
4. **Task Execution Framework**: Guidelines for handling tasks
5. **Tool Usage Guidelines**: Rules for using available tools
6. **Environmental Awareness**: Information about the operational environment
7. **Ethical Guidelines and Limitations**: Safety guardrails and behavioral boundaries
8. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**: Protocols for managing unexpected situations
9. **User Interaction Guidelines**: Rules for communicating with users
10. **Specialized Domain Rules**: Specific guidelines for different types of tasks
11. **Task Completion Protocol**: Process for finalizing and delivering results

## Customization

To customize the agent for your specific needs:

1. **Modify System Prompt**: Adjust the tone, capabilities, and guidelines to match your use case
2. **Add/Remove Tools**: Update the function definitions to include only the tools needed
3. **Adjust Environment Variables**: Set environment-specific details
4. **Create Custom Specialized Rules**: Add domain-specific rules for your particular applications

## Implementation Notes

- The system prompt should be processed to replace all placeholders before being used
- Function definitions should match the actual implementation of available tools
- Consider implementing a feedback mechanism to improve agent performance over time
- For production use, add appropriate error handling and retry logic

## Example Usage

See `agent_initialization.js` for an example of how to initialize and configure the agent programmatically.
