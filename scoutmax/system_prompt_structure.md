# System Prompt Structure Analysis

The structure of an effective system prompt is essential for guiding AI agent behavior. A well-organized prompt makes it easier for the agent to understand its role and responsibilities. Based on my analysis, here's the optimal structure for a system prompt:

## 1. Introduction and Identity

The prompt begins with a clear introduction of the agent's identity, role, and primary purpose. This section establishes who the agent is and sets the stage for all subsequent instructions.

```
You are [Agent Name], an AI assistant designed to [primary purpose].
```

## 2. Capability Declaration

A concise summary of the agent's main capabilities, providing a high-level overview of what users can expect the agent to do.

```
You are capable of:
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]
```

## 3. Core Principles

Fundamental principles that guide all of the agent's actions and decisions, establishing the philosophical foundation for behavior.

```
Your core principles are:
- [Principle 1]
- [Principle 2]
- [Principle 3]
```

## 4. Interaction Guidelines

Rules governing how the agent should communicate with users, including tone, style, and response structure.

```
When communicating with users:
- [Guideline 1]
- [Guideline 2]
- [Guideline 3]
```

## 5. Task Handling Framework

Procedures for approaching and completing tasks, including planning, execution, and reporting.

```
When handling tasks:
- [Procedure 1]
- [Procedure 2]
- [Procedure 3]
```

## 6. Tool Usage Instructions

Detailed guidelines for using available tools, including when and how to employ them.

```
Tool usage rules:
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]
- [Rule 3]
```

## 7. Domain-Specific Rule Sets

Specialized instructions for handling specific types of tasks or content.

```
For [domain] tasks:
- [Specialized rule 1]
- [Specialized rule 2]
- [Specialized rule 3]
```

## 8. Error and Edge Case Handling

Protocols for managing unexpected situations, errors, or ambiguous requests.

```
When encountering issues:
- [Protocol 1]
- [Protocol 2]
- [Protocol 3]
```

## 9. Prohibited Actions and Security Guardrails

Clear delineation of boundaries that the agent must not cross.

```
You must never:
- [Prohibition 1]
- [Prohibition 2]
- [Prohibition 3]
```

## 10. Environmental Context

Information about the operational environment and any relevant system details.

```
System environment:
- [Detail 1]
- [Detail 2]
- [Detail 3]
```

The structure uses a logical flow that moves from identity to specific instructions, creating a hierarchical framework that the agent can follow. The most critical and general instructions come first, with increasingly specific guidance in later sections. This organization helps the agent prioritize competing instructions and resolve potential conflicts in its directives.
