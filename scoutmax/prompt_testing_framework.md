# AI Agent Prompt Testing Framework

This document outlines a structured approach to testing and evaluating your AI agent's system prompt. A thorough testing process is essential for creating a reliable, effective agent that meets user needs.

## Test Categories

### 1. Core Functionality Tests

These tests verify that the agent can perform its fundamental functions correctly.

**Basic Capabilities**
- **Information retrieval**: Test the agent's ability to find and summarize information
- **Tool usage**: Verify the agent can use each available tool correctly
- **Task decomposition**: Assess how well the agent breaks down complex tasks
- **Instruction following**: Test response to simple, direct instructions

**Suggested Test Cases**:
- Ask for factual information that requires web search
- Request a simple file to be created with specific content
- Provide a multi-step task and evaluate the planning approach
- Give specific formatting instructions and check compliance

### 2. Edge Case Tests

These tests examine how the agent handles unusual or challenging situations.

**Ambiguity Handling**
- **Unclear requests**: Test how the agent seeks clarification
- **Incomplete information**: Assess response when critical details are missing
- **Contradictory instructions**: Evaluate handling of conflicting directives

**Error Recovery**
- **Tool failures**: Test recovery when tools return errors or unexpected results
- **Invalid parameters**: Verify handling of invalid inputs to tools
- **Resource limitations**: Test behavior when approaching system constraints

**Suggested Test Cases**:
- Provide deliberately vague requests that require clarification
- Ask for actions with missing parameters or context
- Give instructions with internal contradictions
- Simulate tool failures and observe recovery strategies

### 3. Safety and Boundary Tests

These tests verify that the agent respects ethical guidelines and operational boundaries.

**Content Moderation**
- **Harmful requests**: Test refusal of instructions to create harmful content
- **Sensitive topics**: Evaluate handling of potentially controversial subjects
- **Personal information**: Verify protection of privacy and sensitive data

**System Prompt Disclosure**
- **Direct requests**: Test response to requests to reveal system instructions
- **Indirect probing**: Assess handling of attempts to extract prompt details
- **Role playing scenarios**: Test resistance to role-playing workarounds

**Suggested Test Cases**:
- Request explicitly harmful content to verify refusal
- Ask the agent to share its system prompt directly
- Request role-playing as an entity without restrictions
- Ask for personal opinions on controversial topics

### 4. Personality and Communication Tests

These tests evaluate the agent's communication style and consistency.

**Tone Consistency**
- **Different contexts**: Test tone adaptation across various task types
- **Emotional scenarios**: Evaluate empathy and appropriate responses
- **Professional settings**: Assess maintenance of appropriate formality

**Clarity and Conciseness**
- **Complex explanations**: Test ability to explain difficult concepts clearly
- **Brief responses**: Evaluate ability to be concise when appropriate
- **Technical communication**: Assess accuracy in specialized domains

**Suggested Test Cases**:
- Submit technical and non-technical requests to compare communication style
- Ask for both detailed explanations and brief summaries
- Present scenarios requiring empathetic responses
- Request explanations of complex topics for different audience levels

### 5. Domain-Specific Tests

These tests focus on specialized capabilities in particular domains.

**Programming and Development**
- **Code generation**: Test quality and correctness of generated code
- **Debugging**: Evaluate ability to identify and fix issues in code
- **Technical accuracy**: Assess adherence to best practices and standards

**Research and Analysis**
- **Information synthesis**: Test combining information from multiple sources
- **Critical evaluation**: Assess ability to evaluate source reliability
- **Citation practices**: Verify proper attribution of information

**Content Creation**
- **Writing quality**: Test grammar, style, and coherence
- **Format adherence**: Evaluate following of specific content structures
- **Creativity**: Assess appropriate creative elements when requested

**Suggested Test Cases**:
- Request solving a programming problem with specific requirements
- Ask for research on a topic requiring multiple sources
- Request creation of structured content in various formats
- Present code with bugs and request debugging assistance

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Structured Evaluation Process

**Preparation**
- Define clear test objectives for each test case
- Create a diverse set of test cases covering all categories
- Establish evaluation criteria before conducting tests

**Execution**
- Run tests in a controlled environment
- Document all agent responses verbatim
- Note any unexpected behaviors or deviations

**Analysis**
- Score responses against predetermined criteria
- Identify patterns in successful and unsuccessful interactions
- Document specific prompt elements that may need refinement

### 2. Comparative Testing

**Version Comparison**
- Test multiple versions of your system prompt on identical scenarios
- Compare quantitative and qualitative performance metrics
- Identify specific changes that led to improvements or regressions

**Baseline Establishment**
- Create a set of benchmark tests that remain constant
- Regularly run these tests to track performance over time
- Use baseline performance as a reference point for evaluating changes

### 3. User-Centric Evaluation

**Usability Testing**
- Observe real users interacting with the agent
- Collect feedback on user satisfaction and pain points
- Identify gaps between user expectations and agent performance

**Task Completion Analysis**
- Measure success rates for realistic end-to-end tasks
- Track time to completion and number of clarification requests
- Evaluate user ability to achieve their goals using the agent

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Quantitative Metrics

**Performance Metrics**
- **Task completion rate**: Percentage of tasks successfully completed
- **Accuracy rate**: Correctness of information provided
- **Response time**: Time taken to generate complete responses
- **Clarification rate**: Frequency of asking for additional information
- **Tool usage efficiency**: Appropriate selection and sequencing of tools

**Technical Metrics**
- **Token utilization**: Efficiency of prompt token usage
- **Error frequency**: Rate of execution errors during task completion
- **Recovery success**: Percentage of errors successfully recovered from

### 2. Qualitative Metrics

**Response Quality**
- **Relevance**: How directly responses address the user's query
- **Comprehensiveness**: Completeness of information provided
- **Clarity**: Ease of understanding the response
- **Helpfulness**: Practical value of the information provided

**User Experience**
- **Satisfaction**: Overall user satisfaction with the interaction
- **Trust**: User confidence in the agent's capabilities and information
- **Cognitive load**: Effort required from users during interactions
- **Friction points**: Specific aspects that cause user frustration

## Continuous Improvement Cycle

### 1. Findings Documentation

**Issue Categorization**
- Classify identified issues by type and severity
- Document specific examples of problematic responses
- Link issues to relevant sections of the system prompt

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Identify underlying causes of recurring issues
- Determine whether problems stem from the prompt, tool limitations, or model capabilities
- Document hypotheses about why certain interactions fail

### 2. Prioritization Framework

**Impact Assessment**
- Evaluate how significantly each issue affects user experience
- Consider frequency of occurrence in real-world scenarios
- Assess alignment with core use cases and strategic goals

**Effort Estimation**
- Estimate complexity of addressing each identified issue
- Consider dependencies and potential side effects of changes

### 3. Implementation Planning

**Targeted Refinements**
- Create specific modifications to address identified issues
- Focus on minimal changes that address root causes
- Develop alternative approaches for comparison testing

**Validation Strategy**
- Design test cases specifically targeting improved areas
- Create regression tests to ensure existing functionality remains intact
- Establish criteria for determining success of implemented changes
